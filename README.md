# Spark_Scala
This consists of sample code blocks for spark-scala practice
I have refered to different books and websites while practicing.
I used https://labs.itversity.com/#/ for practice. if I like any website's content or material I have provided them as comments in the code blocks so that it will be useful for refering.
